description = "Cycling Power data is a library to help people use cycing power meters in their circuitpython code. This library allows users to extract power data from a power meter and read the data. The librarys goal is to make it more acessable to create projects involving power meters by streamlining the process of extracting the data from a power meter's bluetooth packet."
